# grimoire-draft

Draft or update Gherkin features and MADR architecture decisions collaboratively with the user.

## Triggers
- User describes new functionality, behavior changes, or feature requests
- User asks to create/update a feature spec or requirement
- User describes a technology choice, architecture decision, or trade-off
- Loose match: contains "feature", "requirement", "spec", "decision", "grimoire" with "create", "draft", "plan", "start", "new"

## Workflow

### 1. Qualify the Request
Before doing anything, determine what kind of change this is:

- **Behavioral** (Given/When/Then expressible) → draft `.feature` files
- **Architectural** (trade-off, choice, structural) → draft MADR decision record
- **Both** → draft features AND decision records
- **Bug fix** → STOP. Tell the user: "The feature file already describes the correct behavior. Let's just fix the code."
- **Refactoring** → STOP. No behavior change = no grimoire artifact. Suggest an ADR only if it's a significant architectural shift.
- **Config/deps/formatting** → STOP. Not grimoire territory.

If unclear, ask the user one clarifying question to route correctly.

### 2. Research Existing Solutions
Before designing anything, search for well-maintained tools, libraries, or frameworks that already solve the problem (or a close variant of it). This applies to both behavioral features and architectural decisions.

- **Search broadly**: npm/PyPI packages, framework built-ins, platform features, SaaS APIs, open-source projects. Use web search if needed.
- **Evaluate what you find**: Is it actively maintained? Does it fit the project's stack and constraints? What are its design trade-offs?
- **Present findings to the user** before drafting:
  - If an existing tool solves the problem well → recommend adopting it. The draft becomes an ADR documenting the adoption decision.
  - If an existing tool is close but has different design trade-offs → document it as prior art. Note what it does well and where the project's needs diverge. This becomes valuable context in the ADR's "Considered Options" and helps future readers understand why custom code was written.
  - If nothing exists → note this in the manifest. A gap in the ecosystem is useful context.
- **The goal is not to avoid writing code** — it's to make informed build-vs-reuse decisions and to learn from existing implementations before designing new ones.

### 3. Check Existing State
- Read `features/` to understand the current behavioral baseline
- Read `.grimoire/decisions/` to understand existing architecture decisions
- Read `.grimoire/docs/context.yml` (if it exists) to understand the deployment environment, related services, and infrastructure — this tells you what's available (caches, queues, sibling services) and what constraints apply (deployment target, environments)
- Check `.grimoire/changes/` for any in-progress changes that might overlap
- If there's a conflict with an active change, flag it

### 4. Scaffold the Change
- Choose a `change-id`: kebab-case, verb-led (`add-`, `update-`, `remove-`)
- Create `.grimoire/changes/<change-id>/`

### 5. Draft Artifacts
**For behavioral changes:**
- Write proposed `.feature` files in `.grimoire/changes/<change-id>/features/<capability>/`
- If modifying an existing feature, copy the current baseline first, then modify
- Follow Gherkin best practices:
  - Feature title + user story (As a / I want / So that)
  - Background for shared preconditions
  - One scenario per behavior
  - Given/When/Then — describe WHAT, never HOW
  - No implementation details in feature files

**For architecture decisions:**
- Write MADR record in `.grimoire/changes/<change-id>/decisions/`
- Use the template from `.grimoire/decisions/template.md` or the AGENTS.md format
- Include considered options, decision drivers, and consequences

**For changes that touch data:**
- Check `.grimoire/docs/data/schema.yml` for the current data schema (if it exists)
- If the change adds, modifies, or removes data models, fields, indexes, or external API integrations, write a `data.yml` in `.grimoire/changes/<change-id>/` showing the proposed schema changes
- Use the same YAML format as `schema.yml` but only include what's changing — new models, added/removed fields, new external API integrations
- Mark changes clearly with `action:` on each entry:

```yaml
# Proposed data changes for: add-user-profiles

users:
  action: modify
  source: src/models/user.py
  fields:
    avatar_url:                    # new field
      action: add
      type: varchar
      nullable: true
    legacy_name:                   # removing a field
      action: remove

profiles:
  action: add                      # entirely new model
  type: collection
  fields:
    user_id: { type: objectId, ref: users }
    bio: { type: string, max_length: 500 }
    social_links:
      type: array
      items:
        platform: { type: string }
        url: { type: string }

github_api:
  action: add                      # new external API dependency
  type: external_api
  provider: GitHub
  schema_ref: https://docs.github.com/en/rest
  client: src/integrations/github.py
  endpoints:
    get_user:
      method: GET
      path: /users/{username}
      response:
        login: { type: string }
        avatar_url: { type: string }
```

- If the change has no data impact, skip `data.yml` entirely — don't create an empty one

**For all changes:**
- Write `manifest.md` listing all artifacts, what's added/modified/removed, and why
- Include an **Assumptions** section: list what must be true for this change to succeed. For each assumption, note whether there is evidence or it is unvalidated. Unvalidated assumptions on the critical path should be flagged to the user.
- Include a **Pre-Mortem** section: imagine this change has failed or caused a production incident 6 months from now — what went wrong? List 2-5 plausible failure modes with mitigations or "accepted" if the risk is acknowledged.
- Before drafting, consider whether **existing tools, libraries, or patterns** already solve the problem. If a well-maintained package, framework feature, or existing codebase utility handles the need, prefer it over writing new code. Note any "build vs. reuse" decisions in the manifest or as an ADR if the choice is significant.

### 6. Collaborate
- Present the draft to the user
- Iterate based on feedback
- Do NOT proceed to plan stage without user approval

### 7. Validate
- Verify `.feature` files have valid Gherkin syntax
- Verify MADR records have valid YAML frontmatter (status, date)
- Verify manifest is complete and accurate
- Every Feature has a user story
- Every Scenario has at least Given + When + Then
- No implementation details leaked into features

## Important
- ONE change at a time. Don't combine unrelated changes.
- Features describe behavior, not implementation. If you catch yourself writing step-level implementation details, you've gone too far.
- The manifest is lightweight glue — don't over-document. Just enough to capture why.
- Always check if a capability/feature already exists before creating a new one.
